                    Part I <br /><br />
                    Vultures are surrounded by more traditions and legends than
                    any other nocturnal creature. Since time immemorial, they
                    have been regarded as monstrous flesh eaters, charismatic
                    masters and terrible masters of the undead. The Vulture
                    race, the most powerful of the undead, was born of an unholy
                    ritual and a dark elixir many thousands of years ago.
                  </div>
                  <div class="slider__item">
                    <br /><br />
                    Though the Vultures are physically strong, fast, and hardy,
                    it is not these qualities that make them so intimidating. It
                    is the will and personal power that makes the Vulture crave
                    great power, and it is this that drives the power that
                    almost all living creatures lack.
                  </div>
                  <div class="slider__item">
                    <br /><br />
                    Vultures are endowed with supernatural ability to control
                    the dead, to become the natural leaders of the armies of the
                    undead that ravage the world. Although hated and persecuted,
                    vultures also lurk in human society. In human society, they
                    take the guise of aristocrats or live in abandoned citadels
                    at the back of civilization.
                  </div>

                  <div class="slider__item">
                    Part II <br /><br />
                    The inner power of the Vultures over death is so strong that
                    you can never know for sure if they are dead or not. They
                    always come back and inflict terrible vengeance on their
                    victims when they don't expect it at all. The Vultures may
                    sleep for years, decades, even centuries, while their
                    servants prepare the opportunity to restore them to their
                    former power.

                    <br /><br />
                    Once the Vultures are filled with power again, they will
                    assemble a horde of the undead and go to war, fighting to
                    fulfill their vicious ambitions. The Vultures gather secret
                    communities in the ruins of ruined palaces and citadels.
                    They know that no one will disturb them. They know that they
                    are the masters of this world.

                  <div class="slider__item">
                    Part III <br /><br />
                    A relentless horde, the unstoppable and terrifying undead
                    are some of the most dangerous foes of all mythical
                    creatures. The resurrected Vultures are a terrifying and
                    mighty army. You cannot disagree with them, they cannot be
                    bribed or stopped. They know neither fear nor pity. It needs
                    neither sleep, nor warmth, nor drink, nor good food.

                    Nothing strikes fear into the hearts of men like the sight
                    of the reviving dead. Their corpses are wrapped in burial
                    robes, and they are armed with ancient and rusty weapons -
                    visions of doom. Faced with that which haunts human beings
                    in nightmares, most mortals feel indescribable horror. And
                    only the bravest warriors will remain in their positions...

                Each of the Vulture holders will receive passive income from
                staking. And once our platform is created, there will be huge
                benefits for holders. As our token will be the only payment
                currency on the platform. Also, the holders will receive a
                profit of several percent of each transaction on our site. The
                more NFT you have - the more you will earn.

                Is it a platform for e-commerce? Or a trading platform? Thanks
                to our platform, people will not need to run around sol sniper,
                check rarity rank, etc. We provide all the comfortable
                conditions for quality trading of your nft. The platform will be
                available for everyone, BUT! Since we will similarly promote our
                token, the platform will fully interact with the token. This
                will give a good boost to the growth of $VULT. And it will
                benefit everyone.

                Stable coins or the $Vult Token? It will be a professional
                trading for whales. And also a help in earning for inexperienced
                people, as our service will provide an opportunity to learn all
                about a particular nft for a couple of $VULT. Our token will be
                a stable coin that will be present in all transactions. And
                people will earn income from it. Also people will get income
                from staking.

                We don't sit idly by, and long before we opened discord, we
                started developing our platform and token. The bear market has
                people spinning around nft projects in fear of losing money.
                With us, you will forget about that. Our platform will be
                completely dependent on our token, and the people who will use
                the platform services will fully interact with the $VULT token.
                And that will be one of the top priorities for holders.
              </div>
              <div class="slider__item">
                <br /><br />
                You'll get revenue from both staking and a % of the transactions
                that our customers will make. Any purchase, any item put up will
                bring you a profit. The more nft you purchase - the more your
                income will be. $VULT token in the future will be traded on many
                exchanges and you can easily withdraw it and get your money.

                After the first collection is minted, each holder will have the
                opportunity to start staking. Every week you will receive a
                minimum of 4 $VULT tokens (depending on how many NFTs you have).
                By the time the platform is created and our main collection is
                released, you will have enough tokens. And you will have a huge
                advantage over regular users. <br /><br />
